## Introduction

Sayings grids are exercises in visual tracking during auditory processing by providing instructions for completing phrases within a grid. 

## Special Considerations

All considerations noted in the [General Guidelines][guidelines] apply. 

## Format

Sayings grids make use of a table composed of twenty (20) columns and twenty (20) rows, not including the column and row labels. The columns are labeled from 1 to 20 and the rows are labeled from A to T.

Instructions for the grid are read aloud with a pause between instructions. The pause will vary with difficulty. See difficulty specifications below. 

Near the middle of the instructions, the participant should be directed to consider what phrase is taking shape on the grid before them.

At the end of the instructions, the phrase completed in the grid should be provided.

## Difficulty Progression

The difficulty of a sayings grid is determined by a combination of the following factors:
- the pause between instructions
- the deviation of the order of the instructions from the simplest means for the participant to complete the grid.
- the number of instructions needed to complete the grid (characters within the saying)
- the distance of the cells being filled in from column and row labels.
- the direction of the phrase within the grid. This is language dependent. In English (for example), Right-to-Left, Top-Down configurations are simpler than those that are Left-to-Right and/or Bottom-Up.

### Instruction Formats
Replace upper case words in the instruction formats below with their references.

A: "In ROW-COLUMN, place the letter LETTER."
B: "In COLUMN-ROW, place the letter LETTER."

C: "Place the letter LETTER in ROW-COLUMN."
D: "Place the letter LETTER in COLUMN-ROW."

E: "In ROW-COLUMN, place the ORDERNAL letter in the word WORD."
F: "In COLUMN-ROW, place the ORDERNAL letter in the word WORD."

G: "Place the ORDERNAL letter in the word WORD in ROW-COLUMN."
H: "Place the ORDERNAL letter in the word WORD in COLUMN-ROW."

### Simple Difficulty

- The pause between instructions should be no less than 2 seconds and no more than 4 seconds. This may vary between individual instructions. 
- Instructions should follow one of the instruction formats A, B, C or D throughout for the simplest, and may use any of the instruction formats A, B, C or D for those closer to moderate difficulty, though one format should predominate.
- The instructions should come in an order that has the participant moving away from the row and column labels. 
- Blocks of instruction should keep within 5 rows (up or down) and columns (right or left) from the last instruction.
- The number of instructions to complete the grid should be between thirty (30) and fifty (50).

### Moderate Difficulty

- The pause between instructions should be no less than 1.5 seconds and no more than 3 seconds, which may vary between individual instructions. 
- Instructions should follow instruction formats A, B, C and/or D in a random pattern throughout. 
- Blocks of instruction should keep within 8 rows (up or down) and columns (right or left) from the last instruction.
- The number of instructions to complete the grid should be between fifty (50) and eighty (80).

### Advanced Difficulty

- The pause between instructions should be no less than 1 second and no more than 2 seconds.
- Instructions may follow any instruction format, with a preference for formats E, F, G, and H.
- The grid should be completed in a random order.
- The number of instructions to complete the grid should be between fifty (50) and one hundred fifty (150).
