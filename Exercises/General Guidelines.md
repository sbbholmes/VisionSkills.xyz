# General Guidelines for Vision Training

First and foremost, **CHECK WITH YOUR EYE DOCTOR BEFORE STARTING VISION TRAINING!** This cannot be emphasized enough. 

- Set up a suitable schedule for doing your vision training. Follow it regularly and without exception. 
- Rest periods may be needed during your training. Never work to a point of fatigue or discomfort. 
- Always do your training under good lighting conditions. 
- Have a relaxed but alert, well-balanced posture when performing standing and sitting exercises. 
- As you begin, some of the first training routines may seem to you to be very simple and easy to do. Do not neglect them. They are laying a good foundation for more difficult procedures to follow. 
- As you progress into more exacting techniques, do not become discouraged if you seem to get stuck. Practice. If you reach a plateau, let it go for a day or two and come back and try again. 
- If you are unsure about a certain technique, **ask for clarification from your eye doctor**. Do not take the chance of practicing incorrectly. 

PLEASE NOTE: It is not uncommon for some to experience headaches, blurred vision or eye fatigue after vision training. Delayed muscle pain can be an indication that you need to pay more attention to what your eyes are feeling as you perform the training, but do make sure to follow up with your eye doctor. There have been cases of individuals discovering major dysfunctions with their eyes during vision training.

## Helpful Hints: 
- Shorten time for troublesome exercises. 
- Relax the eyes by looking off into the distance i.e. sky, trees, clouds. 
- Do eye massages
