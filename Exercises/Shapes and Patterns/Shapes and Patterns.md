## Introduction

This exercise helps build visual memory by having participants re-create the designs they are given.

## Special Considerations

All considerations noted in the [General Guidelines][guidelines] apply. 

## Format

The Shapes and Patterns exercise makes use of a square grid composed of dots. The designs are made by connecting the dots in the gird with direct lines (no curves). Participants may have as much time as they desire to study the design before attempting to re-create it. While re-creating the design, participants should not be able to view the original design.

## Difficulty Progression

The difficulty of this exercise is influenced most by the complexity of the design being copied, with the following factors being of particular concern:
- the size of the grid upon which the designs are based
- the number of times lines change direction 
- how many times the participant needs to lift their pen to re-create the design
- how many smaller shapes are present within the design

### Simple Difficulty

- the grid should be a three by three (3x3) square
- the design should contain no more than two (2) intersecting lines
- the design should be contiguous
- the design should use simple geometric shapes

### Moderate Difficulty

- the grid should be a four by four (4x4) square
- the design should contain no more than four (4) intersecting lines
- the design should be mostly contiguous
- the design should use simple geometric shapes which may or may not combine to form recognizable images

### Advanced Difficulty

- the grid should be a five by five (5x5) square
- the design should contain no more than six (6) intersecting lines
- the design should combine simple geometric shapes into recognizable images
