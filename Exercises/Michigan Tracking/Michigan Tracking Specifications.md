## Introduction

Michigan Tracking assists participants in identifying shape contours in increasingly more crowded settings. The focus of this exercise is to emphasis accuracy, and then maintaining accuracy while improving the time it takes the participant to complete each iteration of the exercise. 

As this exercise is intended mostly to aide participants in learning how to track during reading, the scope of this specification will be limited to developing text-based exercises.

## Special Considerations

All considerations noted in the [General Guidelines][guidelines] apply. 

## Format

This type of tracking exercise has participants scanning for letter patterns within blocks of text. A monospace font, such as Courier, is recommended for these exercises.

## Difficulty Progression

Difficulty is affected by the following:
- the amount white space around the letters being scanned
- the size of the letters being scanned
- the complexity of the letter pattern being sought
- the similarity of letter patterns within the text being scanned

### Simple Difficulty

- use a font-size similar to the printed size of Courier at 14 points
- vary text block lengths within five characters (ex. using a range of words between 3 and 8 characters in length)
- use a search pattern that participants are already familiar with, such as the ordered alphabet


### Moderate Difficulty

- use a font-size similar to the printed size of Courier at 12 points
- vary text block lengths within three characters
- have participants search for recognizable words

### Advanced Difficulty

- use a font-size similar to the printed size of Courier at 10 points
- use uniform text block lengths
- have participants search for random letter combinations
