## Introduction

Word finds help participants to recognize patterns within a crowded setting.

## Special Considerations

All considerations noted in the [General Guidelines][guidelines] apply. 

## Format

Word finds make use of a table of letters, with in which are words that participants are tasked to find. It is recommended to use a monospace font, such as Courier, for the letters used in the table.

## Difficulty Progression

The following factors contribute to the difficulty level of word finds:
- the size of the table (number of row and columns) used in the word find
- the size of the font used
- the direction of words hidden in the table (right-to-left or left-to-right, up or down, diagonals)
- the manner in which the words to be found are listed
- the length of the words to be found

### Simple Difficulty

- the words to be found should be between four (4) and eight (8) characters in length
- the word list should be explicitly given and in alphabetical order
- the table should contain between ten (10) and fifteen (15) columns and a like number of rows
- the words to be found should be oriented in the standard direction(s) for the language used to create the word find
- the font used should be equivalent to the printed size of Courier at 14 points

### Moderate Difficulty

- the words to be found should be between four (4) and twelve (12) characters in length
- the word list should be explicitly given, but may be in a random order
- the table should contain between fifteen (15) and twenty (20) columns and a like number of rows
- the words to be found should be predominantly oriented in the standard direction(s) for the language used to create the word find with only a few diagonals and reversed words
- the font used should be equivalent to the printed size of Courier at 12 points

### Advanced Difficulty

- the words to be found should be between four (4) and twenty (20) characters in length
- the word list may be explicitly given, or identified by a theme or other types of hints
- the table should contain between fifteen (15) and twenty-five (25) columns and a like number of rows
- the words to be found should be oriented in all directions
- the font used should be equivalent to the printed size of Courier at 10 points
