## Introduction

Progression grids are exercises in visual tracking during auditory processing by providing instructions for creating images by drawing lines between numbers. 

## Special Considerations

All considerations noted in the [General Guidelines][guidelines] apply. 

## Format

Progressions grids make use of a table composed of ten (10) columns and seventeen (17) rows. Each cell in the table is numbered, beginning at 1 and incrementing by 1, ending at 170.

Instructions for the grid are read aloud, with a pause between instructions. The pause will vary with difficulty. See difficulty specifications below.

Near the middle of the instructions, the participant should be directed to consider what image is taking shape on the grid before them.

At the end of the instructions, a verbal description and/or image of the correctly completed grid should be provided.

## Difficulty Progression

The difficulty of a progression grid is determined by a combination of the following factors:
- the pause between instructions
- the deviation of the order of the instructions from the simplest means for the participant to complete the grid without lifting their pencil.
- the number of instructions needed to complete the grid
- the distance along the grid between the numbers being joined within an instruction
- the direction of the line being drawn between numbers. This is language dependent. In English (for example), Right-to-Left, Top-Down instructions are simpler than Left-to-Right, Bottom-Up instructions

### Instruction Format
"Draw a line from NUMBER to NUMBER." Replace the NUMBER placeholders with the appropriate numbers.

### Simple Difficulty

- The pause between instructions should be no less than 2 seconds and no more than 4 seconds. This may vary between individual instructions. 
- Instructions should follow the same direction throughout the exercise. 
- The instructions should come in an order that has the participant moving from top to bottom to complete the grid with a minimal scrambling of the order of instructions. 
- Avoid instructions that create diagonal lines.
- The number of instructions to complete the grid should be between twenty (20) and thirty (30).

### Moderate Difficulty

- The pause between instructions should be no less than 1.5 seconds and no more than 3 seconds, which may vary between individual instructions. 
- Instructions should follow either the same side-to-side or top-bottom direction throughout, while the other direction may vary between individual instructions. 
- The grid should be completed either from top to bottom or from bottom to top without jumping between more than four rows between instructions. 
- Instructions that create diagonal lines should not cause the participant to draw a line that crosses more than one (1) column and one (1) row.
- The number of instructions to complete the grid should be between twenty (20) and forty (40).

### Advanced Difficulty

- The pause between instructions should be no less than 1 second and no more than 2 seconds.
- Instructions should vary direction throughout.
- The grid should be completed in a random order.
- Instructions that create diagonal lines should not cause the participant to draw a line that crosses more than three (3) columns and three (3) rows.
- The number of instructions to complete the grid should be between thirty (30) and fifty (50).
