## PURPOSE

VisionSkills.xyz will be a website providing visual perception related information, exercises, and resources free of charge to the general public. 

## WHAT IS VISUAL PERCEPTION?

The difference between eyesight and visual perception is akin to the difference between physical fitness and skill at a particular sport. Eyesight is a matter of visual acuity and is mostly influenced by the shape of our eyes. Being far- or short- sighted is a matter of eyesight. Visual perception, on the other hand, is a physical skill, requiring developing specific muscle sets around and attached to the eyes, much like throwing a baseball requires developing muscles in and around the shoulder. While having good eyesight makes it easier to perceive things, good eyesight does not automagically give you good perception, nor is good perception wholly reliant on good eyesight.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Roles that I'm looking to fill include the following:
- Subject Matter Experts: individuals who can help with developing specifications for code-able content
- Coders: People proficient in PHP and javascript, and JAVA for off-line exercise resources 
- Copyeditors: Let our friends find our flaws first!

Please review the [Code of Conduct][https://github.com/shaybella/VisionSkills.xyz/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md] for this project before contributing.

Additionally, this is my first time getting involved in open source projects, so guidance or mentoring on the peculiarities of managing an open source project are welcome!
